#### Team management

Once you have signed up with `amp signup`, you can start creating teams and add members.

To create a team, just specify team name as an argument to the `team create` command:
```
$ amp team create team
Team has been created.
```

After creating a team, you will be the owner of that team and you can then add other users to that team.

In addition to creating new teams, you can delegate resources in the form of stacks using the `amp team resource` commands.

For more information on team management, see the [team documentation](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/blob/master/docs/team.md)
